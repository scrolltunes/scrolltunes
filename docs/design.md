# ScrollTunes - Design Document

## Overview

A web app that displays scrolling lyrics synced to a live musical performance. The app detects when a performer starts singing and automatically synchronizes the lyrics display to the song's timing.

## Problem Statement

Live musicians and karaoke performers need a lyrics teleprompter that syncs to their **live performance**, not a pre-recorded track. Traditional karaoke apps require playing the original audio, which doesn't work for acoustic/live scenarios.

## Core Concept

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    LIVE PERFORMANCE                         │
│                                                             │
│   🎸 Guitarist plays intro...  │  📱 App: lyrics WAITING   │
│                                │      (paused at start)     │

│   🎤 Singer starts: "Hello..." │  📱 App: DETECTS VOICE →  │

│                                │      → scrolling begins    │
│                                │                            │
│   🎵 Performance continues     │  📱 Lyrics scroll at       │
│                                │      song's known tempo    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## User Flow

1. User selects a song (searches via Spotify or other music provider)
2. App fetches lyrics with timestamps from lyrics API
3. App enters **waiting state** — lyrics visible but paused at the beginning
4. App listens via device microphone for vocal onset
5. **Trigger**: Voice detected → timestamp jumps to first lyric's timecode
6. Lyrics auto-scroll at the song's pre-defined pace from that sync point
7. User can click any lyric line to manually jump to that timecode

## Key Assumptions

- Performer plays at roughly the **original song tempo**
- Only need to detect **when** singing starts, not **what** is being sung
- Initial sync is always to **first lyric line** (no mid-song detection yet)

## Open Questions

- **False positives** — Guitar strums or audience noise triggering early? Need robust voice-vs-instrument discrimination
- **Manual override** — Tap to re-sync if detection fails?

## Backlog / Future Features

### 1. Tempo Adjustment

**Priority**: High | **Version**: MVP+

**Manual Mode**:
- Slider control to adjust playback tempo (e.g., 50% - 150% of original)
- Presets: "Slower", "Original", "Faster"
- Remember per-song tempo preferences

**Auto-Detection Mode** (future):
- Analyze live audio to detect current playing tempo via beat detection
- Continuously adjust scroll speed to match performer's tempo
- Handle tempo drift gracefully — live performers don't play to a click track
- Use onset detection and beat tracking (librosa/essentia algorithms) to estimate BPM in real-time
- Smoothing algorithm to avoid jarring speed changes

---

### 2. Karaoke Mode

**Priority**: High | **Version**: v1.0

Full-screen karaoke display optimized for stage/TV viewing:

- **Large text display** — Current line prominent, next line preview
- **Per-word highlighting** — Words illuminate as they should be sung
- **Bouncing ball animation** — Classic karaoke visual cue tracking word timing
- **Color themes** — Dark mode for stage, high-contrast options
- **Dual-line view** — Show current + upcoming line for singer preparation
- **Countdown indicator** — Visual cue before singing starts (e.g., "3... 2... 1...")

Technical considerations:
- Word-level timestamps required (not all lyrics APIs provide this)
- Fallback: estimate word timing based on line duration and syllable count

---

### 3. Jam Session Mode

**Priority**: Medium | **Version**: v1.5

Collaborative session for groups/parties:

**Session Creation**:
- Host creates a jam session with unique ID
- Generates shareable one-time URL
- QR code generation for easy mobile access

**Guest Access**:
- Join anonymously or with custom display name
- No account required for guests
- Session expires after configurable time (e.g., 4 hours)

**Features**:
- **Song queue** — Guests can search and add songs to shared playlist
- **Voting** — Upvote/downvote queued songs to prioritize
- **Now playing** — All participants see current lyrics
- **Host controls** — Skip, remove, reorder queue; kick users
- **Chat** (optional) — Simple text chat for coordination

Technical considerations:
- WebSocket-based real-time sync
- Rate limiting to prevent queue spam
- Session state stored temporarily (Redis or similar)

---

### 4. Word-Level Detection (Smart Sync)

**Priority**: Medium | **Version**: v2.0

Detect which words/lines are being sung and jump to that position:

**Use Cases**:
- Skip spoken intros in studio versions when performing live
- Jump into any verse/chorus directly
- Re-sync mid-song if performer skips a section
- Handle songs where live versions differ from studio arrangement

**Technical Approach**:
- Speech-to-text (STT) on live audio input
- Fuzzy matching detected words against lyrics
- Confidence threshold before jumping (avoid false matches)
- Consider phonetic matching for sung words (stretched vowels, etc.)

**Challenges**:
- Real-time STT accuracy with background music
- Handling singing vs. speaking (different acoustic properties)
- Multiple languages support

---
